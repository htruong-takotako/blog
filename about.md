### January 2021
As a python developper I'm currently working on a full stack automation tool for network fabric management at a leading french international bank.

On my spare time, I keep working on devops skills, preparing a RHEL8 certification and experimenting with languages and frameworks out of my confort zone including Flutter and Rustlang.

My hobbies include video games, Japan (cooking, language and travels) and my bikes that get me everywhere, everyday, under any condition :D (also developped a backpack addiction due to my bike commuting).
