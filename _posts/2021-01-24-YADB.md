While it is just "yet another dev blog", this one is way overdue and is mainly intended for myself. Transitionning from a young **IT** analyst/project manager, to a **network** architect, to a full time **Python** developper has been a long journey.

Now this journey is far from being over and new exciting paths lay ahead. Be it through online documentation,  trainings, wikis, tutorials and blogs, learning by one-self has become easier and I want to focus my attention towards two fields:

 - DevOps culture,
 - Video game development.

The first is my main occupation and encompasses a great deal of disciplines that I have yet to master. The second is more of a hobby but also a distant target, which will lead me to discover many fields totally disconnected from my main occupation.

Maintaining this blog is meant to:

 - track my progress and archive all the great resources that helped me towards even the smallest achievements
 - organise my thoughts to consolidate my learnings
 - hopefully help a friend, a colleague or by any chance a total stranger to overcome the same hurdles and challenges I faced.
